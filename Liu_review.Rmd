# Liu Review

This file is Huyu Liu's review of Hazinia's R assignment.

## Part II: Data Processing

### Step 4

When change "?/?" to "-", it can be done in one step directly instead of two.

#### Part iii

The order and write file step can be writen into `for` loop.

#### Part iv

Same problem with "Part iii".

### Step 5

Same problem with "Step 4".

## Part III: Data Visualization

### SNPs per chromosome

x axis need to be adjusted with `theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust =  , hjust =  , angle =  ))` to deal with the overlap of the text.

And chromosomes are not in order.


### Uknown Data
### "Your own visualization
Unfinished, no codes exist when I review.
